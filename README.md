# Kickserv

A Ruby wrapper for the Kickserv REST API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kickserv'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kickserv

## Usage

### Configuration

Before you can make calls to Kickserv you must configure the library with a valid API Token and a valid subdomain.
An employeeâ€™s unique API token can be found in the employee management section of your Kickserv account.

There are two ways to configure the  gem. You can pass a hash of configuration options when you create
a client, or you can use a configure block.

```ruby
client = Kickserv.client(api_key: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", subdomain: "YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE")
```

```ruby
Kickserv.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
  config.subdomain = "YOUR_SUBDOMAIN_HERE"
end

client = Kickserv.client
```
